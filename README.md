Paul Bliudzius and Matt Rocco
=========

We did not make the UI for this application

For our project we developed our own Sudoku Solver.
We only rewrote the solveSudoku function Lines: 1-196 inside Demo.js
Simple open up index.html in a web browser to check it out.
The functionality does not use the Level of game since we give it ready Sudoku board to test out.

1. Click new game, or reload the page.
2. Click Solve.
3. Click Check if you do not believe it is solved.
